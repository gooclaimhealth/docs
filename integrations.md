# 🔗 EHR & FHIR Integrations

Gooclaim is designed to integrate seamlessly with major Electronic Health Record (EHR) platforms using **HL7 FHIR APIs**.  
These integrations will enable automated claim coding, prior authorization, denial prediction, and appeals within provider workflows.

## 🌐 Current Status
Gooclaim is in the **ongoing process of integrating with EHR platforms**.  
We are actively working with pilot partners to build and validate integrations with:

- **Epic** (FHIR APIs & SMART on FHIR OAuth2)  
- **Cerner Millennium** (FHIR APIs)  
- **Athenahealth** (FHIR & REST APIs)  

📌 These integrations are **in progress**.
